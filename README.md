## Twitter Client React Micro-Frontend

This frontend application is built on React. This project can be easily hosted on Vercel. All you need to do is set these specific environmental variables. 

    REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=<your-custom-secret-code>
    REACT_APP_BASE_URL=<your-backend-base-url>

- The secret code acts as a password to this frontend application of yours to make sure that it's just you who is able to get in. 
- The base URL will be the localhost URL of the server that you're running while running the project locally, and it will be your backend's base URL in production.

The backend for this application is written in Node. You can find the code for the backend [here](https://github.com/shantanubr/x-be).
